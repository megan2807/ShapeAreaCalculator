# Shape Area Calculator C++ Program

This program is a simple command-line tool that calculates the area of common geometric shapes. Users can choose from Square, Rectangle, Circle, or Triangle and provide the necessary dimensions in meters. The calculated area is then displayed.

## Supported Shapes & Formulas

* **Square:** `Area = side * side`
* **Rectangle:** `Area = length * width`
* **Circle:** `Area = π * radius * radius` (using π ≈ 3.142)
* **Triangle:** `Area = 0.5 * base * height`

## How to Use

1.  The program will prompt you to select a shape (square, rectangle, circle, or triangle).
2.  Enter the name of the desired shape.
3.  Follow the subsequent prompts to enter the required dimensions (e.g., side length, length, width, radius, base, height).
4.  The calculated area will be displayed in square meters.

## Example Interaction
Please select a shape (square, rectangle, circle, triangle): circle
What is the radius in meters? 5
The area of your shape is: 78.55 square meters

## Getting Started
To compile and run this program:

1.  **Save the code**: Save the C++ code as `main.cpp` in a directory.
2.  **Compile**: Use a C++ compiler  to compile the source file:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o shape_calculator
    ```
3.  **Run**: Execute the compiled program:
    ```bash
